Rough set theory (RST) is a mathematical  framework that deals with uncertainty  

An information system IS or S is presented mathematically  as a pair 
S = (U,A) 
Where U is finite , nonempty set called the universe 
A is finite , nonempty set called set of attributes  we associate Va with its values called the domain of a

Decision system , DS or S , is a triple 
DS = (U,C,D)
U is a universal set 
C condition set 
D is decision set
DS = (U,A)  where A = C U D

C and D are disjoint non-empty attribute sets

To present the DS to computer system we need to present the main 2 objects  the universal object and attribute


Firstly create new User on sql server "Permanent" 
Create database with the owner Permanent
Restore backup file RoughBack
When you run the application runs first time it will requires the server connection data
From Main Data menu set the attributes 
Then set the universe from the main form
Then open the discernibility  matrix from the main menu
